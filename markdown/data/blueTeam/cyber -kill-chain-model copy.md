# Encryption algorithms

AES (Advanced Encryption Standard): This is a widely-used symmetric encryption algorithm that is considered to be very secure. It has been used by numerous types of ransomware, including Cryptolocker and WannaCry.

RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman): This is an asymmetric encryption algorithm that is often used in combination with AES. It is commonly used by ransomware to encrypt the victim's files and generate a unique decryption key that is needed to restore access to the files.

Crypton: This is a custom encryption algorithm that was developed by the creators of the Cryptowall ransomware. It is based on the Blowfish algorithm and is designed to be very difficult to break.

Locker: This is a custom encryption algorithm that was developed by the creators of the Locker ransomware. It is based on the AES algorithm and is also designed to be very difficult to break.
