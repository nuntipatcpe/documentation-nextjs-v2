# Cyber threats

- A cyber or cybersecurity threat is a malicious act that
  seeks to damage data, steal data, or disrupt digital life in general.
  Cyber threats include computer viruses, data breaches, Denial of
  Service (DoS) attacks, and other attack vectors.

- Although cybersecurity professionals work hard to close security
  gaps, attackers are always looking for new ways to escape IT
  notice, evade defense measures, and exploit emerging
  weaknesses. The latest cybersecurity threats are putting a new
  spin on “known” threats, taking advantage of work-from-home
  environments, remote access tools, and new cloud services
