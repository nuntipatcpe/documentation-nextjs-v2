# Cybersecurity

- is the practice of protecting critical systems
  and sensitive information from digital attacks. Also known as
  information technology (IT) security, cybersecurity measures are
  designed to combat threats against networked systems and
  applications, whether those threats originate from inside or
  outside of an organization

# Cybersecurity domain

- Cybersecurity domains refer to the various forms where
  cybersecurity methodologies can be implemented. Application
  security, physical security, risk assessment, and threat
  intelligence are some of the most common domains in cyber
  security.
  Cybersecurity domains are also called cyber security categories,
  focus areas, and tiers
  An organization considers the various cybersecurity domains
  while building a cybersecurity policy. Therefore, you can also call
  them domains of cyber security policy.

## Domain 1: Frameworks & Standards

- Cybersecurity frameworks and standards are the set
  of best practices to keep cybersecurity risk under check. These
  offer the ability to determine risk tolerance and set controls.

- Cyber security frameworks and standards:
  CIS (Center for Internet Security) Controls
  CISA (Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency)
  MITRE ATT&CK
  NIST (National Institute of Technologies)
  PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)

## Domain 2: Application Security

- Application security is
  installing many forms of defenses
  within all software and services
  belonging to an organization to
  provide protection from a diverse
  range of threats. It simply means
  to safeguard applications that an
  organization develops, deploys,
  and uses.

## Domain 3: Risk Assessment

- Risk assessment is the process of carefully analyzing the
  workplace for identifying scenarios, processes, et cetera that
  might cause harm to assets, i.e., people and systems belonging to
  an organization.

  **consists of**:

  - Hazard identification
  - Risk analysis and risk evaluation
  - Risk control

## Domain 4: Enterprise Risk Management

- Enterprise Risk Management or ERM is an
  organization-specific strategy that aims to identify and prepare
  for hazards within an organizationâ€™s finances, objectives, and
  operations. It is risk management applied to an organization.

**The subdomains of ERM include:**

- Crisis management
- Cyber insurance
- Lines of defense
- Risk acceptance statement
- Risk appetite

## Domain 5: Governance

- Cyber security governance offers a strategic view of
  how an organization defines its risk appetite, develops
  accountability frameworks, and establishes decision-making. It
  involves taking decisions for implementing security policies.

- Governance aims to ensure that the organization manages to
  make the right decisions most of the time and places efficient
  and cost-effective policies to mitigate risk. Company written
  policy, executive management involvement, and laws and
  regulations are subdomains of governance.

## Domain 6: Threat Intelligence

- Threat Intelligence also known as cyber threat
  intelligence (CTI) is the process of collecting information
  from a wide array of resources pertaining to existing or potential
  attacks against an organization.

## Domain 7: End-user Education

- The main intent of end-user education is to develop
  awareness in employees and equip them with the required skills
  and tools so that they can protect themselves and the
  organization from data attacks or data loss.

- The 3 domains of information security are confidentiality,
  integrity, and availability. These information security domains are
  collectively known as the CIA triad. Awareness, cybersecurity
  tabletop exercises, and training are part of end-user education.

## Domain 8: Security Operations

- Security operations pertain to the tasks that put security
  plans into action. It covers applying resource protection
  techniques, disaster recovery, incident management, managing
  physical security, and understanding and supporting
  investigations.

- This domain of cyber security also involves logging and
  monitoring services, requirements for investigation types, and
  securing the provision of resources.

## Domain 9: Physical Security

- Physical security is the process of protecting people,
  property, and physical assets from events and scenarios that can
  result in damage or loss. Different cybersecurity teams need to
  work in line to secure the digital and physical assets of an
  organization.

## Domain 10: Career Development

- Unbelievably, career development is also classified as one
  of the cyber domains. This is because the demand for skilled and
  qualified cybersecurity professionals has increased.

- Career development in cybersecurity includes certifications,
  conferences, peer groups, self-study, training, and so on.

## Domain 11: Security Architecture

- Security Architecture is a unified security design to
  address the potential risks and requirements of a specific
  condition or environment. Security architecture also specifies
  where and when to apply security controls. This process is
  usually reproducible.
